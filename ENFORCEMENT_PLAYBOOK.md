# NavraLabs IP & License Enforcement Playbook

## Purpose

To protect the Autonomous Engineering Platform (AEP) intellectual property and enforce license terms.

---

## 1. Identify Violation

Check for:
- **Unauthorized public deployment** - ANY hosting of AEP or derivatives (even if free)
- **Published apps or websites** - Clones deployed on domains, cloud platforms, or app stores
- **Rebranded or white-labeled services** - Using AEP code under different branding
- **Code copying without attribution** - Substantial code reuse without proper license compliance
- **Commercial monetization** - Selling, licensing, or offering AEP-based services
- **Fork-and-deploy** - Public GitHub forks that are actively deployed/hosted
- **Trademark violations** - Using "NavraLabs", "AEP", or similar marks

### Detection Methods:
- **GitHub Search**: Search for forks and monitor for deployments
  ```
  site:github.com "Autonomous Engineering Platform" OR "AEP"
  ```
- **Google Dorks**: Find deployed instances
  ```
  inurl:"/api/context/pack" OR inurl:"/api/memory"
  "NavraLabs" OR "Autonomous Engineering"
  ```
- **Domain Monitoring**: Check WHOIS for similar domains
- **Cloud Detection**: Search AWS, Azure, GCP marketplaces for clones
- **Social Media**: Monitor Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit for launches

---

## 2. Document Evidence

Capture:
- GitHub repo URL
- Domain or service URL
- Screenshots of cloned UI or code reuse
- API endpoints or commit logs proving derivation
- WHOIS info or business details

## 6. Automated Detection & Prevention

### GitHub Fork Monitoring (Setup Required)

Create a GitHub Action to monitor forks:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/fork-monitor.yml
name: Monitor Forks
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
jobs:
  check-forks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for deployed forks
        run: |
          # Script to check forks for deployments
          # Alert if detected
```

### License Verification Server

Add to your app (optional):
```python
# backend/core/license_check.py
import os
import requests

def verify_license_compliance():
    """Check if deployment is authorized"""
    license_key = os.getenv("NAVRALABS_LICENSE_KEY")
    if not license_key:
        # Log unauthorized deployment
        requests.post(
            "https://license.navralabs.com/report",
            json={"unauthorized": True, "ip": get_server_ip()}
        )
        raise Exception("Unauthorized deployment - license required")
```
