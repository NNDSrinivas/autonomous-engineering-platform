- Independent development and testing
- Scalable addition of new agent types
- Clear separation of concerns
- Fault isolation

### **2. Episodic Memory Integration**
All major operations are recorded in episodic memory:
- Product manager sessions with PRD generation
- Agent collaboration threads
- Observability alerts and auto-remediation
- Static analysis sessions with performance metrics
- Patch validation results with rollback history

### **3. LLM-Powered Intelligence**
Strategic use of LLMs for tasks requiring reasoning:
- Product requirement analysis and synthesis
- Collaborative discussion synthesis
- Observability alert recommendation generation
- Code quality analysis
- Conflict resolution in multi-agent scenarios

### **4. Performance Optimizations**
- Incremental analysis only on changed regions
- Intelligent caching with hash-based invalidation
- Dependency tracking to minimize re-analysis scope
- Parallel execution where safe
- Smart timeouts and resource management
