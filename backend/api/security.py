    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Placeholder for future policy dependency.

    This function is a placeholder and will always raise NotImplementedError.
    Do not use this function. Use `check_policy_inline` instead.

    Background:
    This function is currently not implemented because FastAPI's dependency injection
    system cannot easily extract route arguments for dynamic context building.

    Use `check_policy_inline` instead, which allows explicit context passing within
    the route handler after arguments are available.

    Reserved for future enhancement if a clean dependency-based pattern is found.
