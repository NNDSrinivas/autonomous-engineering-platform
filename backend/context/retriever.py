"""Hybrid retrieval engine for Context Pack

Combines semantic search with keyword matching, recency, and authority scoring.

NOTE (PR-16): This module now serves as a thin wrapper around the new
search.backends module which provides pgvector ANN, FAISS, and hybrid BM25 support.
All retrieval logic has been consolidated in search.backends for better maintainability.
