Ingestor Modules - Organizational Knowledge Ingestion

These modules ingest data from various platforms into the memory graph:
- Jira: Issues, comments, links
- Slack: Messages, threads, reactions
- Teams: Conversations, meetings
- Zoom: Meeting recordings, transcripts
- Confluence: Pages, spaces, attachments
- GitHub: PRs, issues, code
- Git repos: Files, commits, branches

Each ingestor creates nodes and edges to build the organizational knowledge graph.
