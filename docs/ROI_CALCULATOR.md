# NAVI ROI Calculator (Draft)

## Inputs
- Engineers on team
- Average hours per week spent on review/testing/debug
- Average hourly cost

## Formula
Weekly savings = (hours_saved_per_engineer * engineers) * hourly_cost

## Example
- 10 engineers
- 3 hours saved per week each
- $100/hr

Weekly savings = 10 * 3 * 100 = $3,000
Annual savings = $3,000 * 52 = $156,000

## TODO
- Validate inputs with real customers
